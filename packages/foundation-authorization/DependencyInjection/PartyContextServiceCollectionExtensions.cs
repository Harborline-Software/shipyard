/// <see cref="IPrincipalPartyResolver"/>. Hosts call this in their production scope so every
/// write endpoint resolves the acting party through this ONE seam — never a body-supplied id.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The facade (<see cref="PartyContext"/>) is registered scoped because it reads the current
/// principal off the per-request <see cref="ITenantContext"/> (itself wired scoped by
/// <c>AddSunfishTenantContext</c>). The v1 resolver is registered as a singleton — its seed map
/// is immutable. When a people-foundation-backed resolver lands, only the
/// <see cref="IPrincipalPartyResolver"/> registration changes; the facade and its consumers are
/// untouched (the interface is the swap seam).
