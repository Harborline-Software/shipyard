/// injected <see cref="ITenantContext"/> sum-interface (which is both
/// <see cref="ICurrentUser"/> and <see cref="Sunfish.Foundation.MultiTenancy.ITenantContext"/>),
/// so the resolved party is always derived from the SAME validated token that carries the
/// caller's identity. This is the confused-deputy guard the <see cref="ICurrentUser"/>
/// doc warns about, realized in code: a consumer cannot combine a UserId from one
/// principal with a tenant from another, and cannot supply a body-controlled party id.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Server-derived, never body-supplied.</b> Because there are no parameters, mutating

/// <c>actingPartyId</c>/<c>workerPartyId</c>/<c>approverPartyId</c>/<c>rejecterPartyId</c>/
/// <c>createdBy</c>/<c>updatedBy</c>/<c>partyId</c>. Callers performing a self-action guard
