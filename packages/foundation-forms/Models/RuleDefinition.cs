/// The keystone substrate declares the rule shape; <b>evaluation lives in

/// The keystone is intentionally inert with respect to rule semantics — it
/// stores rules as data so the form authoring UX, the entity-store write
/// path, the migration tooling, and the cross-device CRDT sync all see the
/// same canonical shape regardless of which evaluator runs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Expression contract:</b> the keystone treats <see cref="Expression"/>
/// as an opaque string. The evaluator interprets it according to
/// <see cref="Tier"/> — JSON Schema text, JsonLogic JSON, or Power Fx text.
/// Validation of the expression's grammar is the evaluator's responsibility;
/// the keystone only validates that the field is non-empty.
