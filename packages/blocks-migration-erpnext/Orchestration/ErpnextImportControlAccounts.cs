/// <para>
/// <b>Why these are inputs, not derived (architecture Finding 3).</b> The spec §8 flag set has no
/// control-account flag, and the imported <see cref="GLAccount"/> preserves only the coarse
/// 5-value <c>GLAccountType</c> (Asset/Liability/Equity/Revenue/Expense) — it does NOT carry
/// ERPNext's fine-grained <c>account_type</c> ("Receivable", "Payable", …). So the orchestrator
/// cannot reliably pick "the AR control account" out of an imported chart by inspection. Rather
/// than invent a brittle from-chart heuristic, the orchestrator takes the four control accounts
/// as explicit ids and posts against exactly what the caller named.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Population is a documented seam.</b> The CLI host resolves these at RUN time (from the chart
/// the user is importing into, or from flags in a later increment). RUN is CIC-dump-gated
/// (shipyard#270), so deferring real population to the RUN-enablement increment is safe: BUILD and
/// tests supply them directly from synthetic fixtures.
