/// <b>Single-chart by construction.</b> One request targets exactly one <see cref="TargetChart"/>.
/// The extractor carries no company filter in v1, so a multi-company export is driven one request

/// names which chart this run imports into; the multi-chart loop is a CLI-host concern deferred past
/// Phase 1.)
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="Tenant">The tenant all writes are scoped to.</param>
/// <param name="TargetChart">The destination chart of accounts; passes import INTO it (Pass 1 does not create it).</param>

/// <param name="AsOf">The as-of date Pass 6 verifies AR/AP aging and balances against.</param>
