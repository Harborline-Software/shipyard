/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This is a closed discriminated union over FOUR outcomes
/// (ADR 0100 OQ-A; .NET-architect definitive, security-engineering concurring):
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><see cref="Inserted"/> — no prior import; a new local record was created.</item>
///   <item><see cref="Updated"/> — an existing local record was updated to a newer source version.</item>
///   <item><see cref="Skipped"/> — already present at the same/newer version (or an immutable posted record); no write.</item>
///   <item><see cref="Rejected"/> — the record could NOT be imported; carries an <see cref="ImportFailure"/> and NO <typeparamref name="T"/>.</item>
/// </list>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why a DU, not an enum + exception (OQ-A rationale).</b> The reject is a
/// first-class union arm, not an <c>ImportAction</c> enum value and not a
/// propagating exception. C# exhaustiveness analysis turns "you forgot to handle
/// the reject" into a COMPILE error (the friendliest failure), closing the
/// silent-financial-record-drop vector (C2/C5) that a too-broad
/// <c>catch (Exception)</c> would reopen. The contract surface the orchestrator
/// consumes MUST be the DU value, never a propagating exception (an upserter MAY
/// throw internally, but it converts at its own boundary).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The constructor is <c>private protected</c> so the union is closed to this
/// assembly — no third arm-type can be declared externally, which keeps the
/// <see cref="Action"/> projection total and the orchestrator's exhaustive
/// switch sound.
