/// This enum deliberately has <b>no <c>Rejected</c> member</b> (ADR 0100 OQ-A
/// ruling). The reject is a first-class arm of the
/// <see cref="ImportOutcome{T}"/> discriminated union
/// (<see cref="ImportOutcome{T}.Rejected"/>), NOT an enum value — adding a
/// <c>Rejected</c> member would silently weaken exhaustive <c>switch</c>
/// statements that lack a <c>default</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The enum is the canonical replacement for the per-cluster
/// <c>Sunfish.Blocks.*.Migration.ImportAction</c> copies (the D7 duplication
/// the contract collapses to this one owning package). The A-units decide
/// per cluster whether to retire the legacy enum or retain it as a pure
/// happy-path marker projected from the non-reject arms via
/// <see cref="ImportOutcome{T}.Action"/>.
