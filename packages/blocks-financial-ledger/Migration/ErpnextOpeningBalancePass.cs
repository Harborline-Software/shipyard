///     its <c>JournalEntry</c> ctor; this pre-gate makes the opening-balance
///     invariant a first-class, separately-reported reason at the orchestration
///     layer rather than relying on the downstream ctor message.

///   <item>
///     <b>Per-JE transaction.</b> Pass 3's commit boundary is per-JE (ADR 0100 C2

///     entry does not roll back the entries that already succeeded. The pass
///     completes if any opening JE succeeds.
///   </item>
///   <item>
///     <b>Census conservation.</b> Every opening-JE outcome is recorded into an
