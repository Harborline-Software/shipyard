///     entries are this pass's concern; opening JEs are owned by Pass 3
///     (the opening-balance pass). The census conserves over the
///     SUBMITTED-STANDALONE subset the pass actually imports — the pass reports the
///     opening count and the non-submitted count it partitioned out so the
///     orchestrator's report shows no record vanished from the full source set
///     (ADR 0100 C2; the full-source census is the A7 orchestrator's responsibility).

///     records the Pass-6 reconciliation gate counts (ADR 0100 §"Enforcement
///     invariant": "zero unaccounted <c>docstatus==1</c> records"). Draft/Cancelled
///     standalone entries are partitioned out and COUNTED
///     (<see cref="StandaloneJournalEntryImportResult.NonSubmittedCount"/>), never
///     silently dropped (ADR 0100 C2 "no record vanishes"). They are NOT routed into
///     the census because they were never in scope to import — like opening entries,
///     they are a reported-but-deferred partition, not a reject. (A reject is for an
///     in-scope record that FAILED; a non-submitted entry was never in scope.)
///   </item>
///   <item>
///     <b>Per-JE transaction.</b> Pass 4.4's commit boundary is per-JE (ADR 0100 C2

///   </item>
///   <item>
///     <b>Idempotent re-import.</b> The shipped importer is idempotent on

///   </item>
///   <item>
///     <b>Census conservation.</b> Every submitted-standalone-JE outcome is recorded
///     into an <see cref="ImportCensus"/>; the pass calls
///     <see cref="ImportCensus.AssertConserved"/> over the submitted-standalone subset
